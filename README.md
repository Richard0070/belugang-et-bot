# BeluGANG Events Team Bot

Put the Bot token in the `config.py` file. You can also customize the emojis used in different embeds. Use the `/setup` command to configure your bot. If you want to disable a feature, simply edit and remove the value in the Setup Wizard.

**IMPORTANT**

While setting up the modmail forum channel, make sure to add the tags: `open` & `closed`. Otherwise, it won't work properly. Don't forget to give the bot necessary permissions!
